The documentation contained here is for the software implementation of SignLab.
If you are not interested in the nitty gritty of how the code is written for
SignLab, this is not the documentation for you. The documentation contained
here includes initial software requirements, software design considerations,
and implementation details.

Using These Documents
=====================

The documentations are layed out in the doc tree below in order generally from
most abstract first to most specific last. The intention that the earlier
documents capture higher level considerations, and later documents capture
the specifics of the implementation.

For information on the requirements of the system that the software has to
meet, read :ref:`SignLab Software Requirement Specification`.

For an overview of use cases and cooresponding sequence diagrams, read
