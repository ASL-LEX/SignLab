Introduction
============

SignLab is a tool for tagging short videos containing signs with either other
signs or English tags. SignLab is intended to provide an interface for
uploading collected videos and allowing users to tag those videos. Part of
the goal of the application is to provide a platform which is flexible enough
to add additional features to the data tagging and processing logic.
